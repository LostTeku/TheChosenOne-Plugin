# Welcome Welcome!
Greetings Keksis! This is the first of all repositories that i ever created!

This repo contains **all work** of the minecraft plugin development that i ever made!

## Plugin: TheChosenOne
TheChosenOne is a plugin that provides more security to your server. It observers permissions, manages bans and mutes and even more!
This System is fully customizable and is **currently under development**.
But it can feed you already, if you're hungry.

## Warning!
The Development may improve over time, but i am a starter. I am not a professional programmer and i dont want to be. I just want to create things with u guys, so i would really really appreciate of u guys follow me on Twitch for 
coding streams, gaming and fun! :D
